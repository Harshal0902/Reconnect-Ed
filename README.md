# Sustainable Health

## 💡 Inspiration

Around $280 billion were spent on mental health services in 2020, but still many people were unable to get proper care due to lack of funds. Sustainable mental health care works to: Prevent mental illness, develop social capital, and foster mental well-being and individual, societal, and community resilience. Encourage the management of mental health by patients, employees, and caregivers. Cut back on needless activity.
